# TRANSLATION-OF-ARMORED-CORE-4-INTO-PORTUGUESE
Just a Brazilian Armored Core fan working on a Brazilian Portuguese translation to understand the story.

So, I'm just a high school guy who loves robots/mechs and everything related, Transformers, Pacific Rim, and especially now Armored Core, this franchise has become an icon for me, and I'm from Brazil, my English is bad and I only know the basics, this passion started with Armored Core 6, which led me to the other games, the ones from the 7th generation of consoles actually, anyway, they don't have a Brazilian Portuguese version, I don't know much English but I want to understand the story then, and I know that Armored Core is not that well known in Brazil but as a fan I want to be able to bring this, I'm planning and seeing how to translate from English to Brazilian Portuguese, it's a project of my own and I've always imagined Armored Core with more languages, anyway, for now that's it, I'll just do this in the little free time I have since I'm very busy, so whoever is seeing this, whether Brazilian or American, wish me luck because at least What I saw here is not easy to translate, I'm working on it and seeing the ISO version for Xbox 360, since it's easier and more optimized than the PS3 version, this is also for emulators.
